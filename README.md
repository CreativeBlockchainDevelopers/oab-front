# OpenArtBlocks-Frontend-Tezos

This project is part of [OpenArtBlocks](https://github.com/GenArtLabs/OpenArtBlocks), an open-source self-hosted approach to NFT collection publishing on the Tezos and Ethereum blockchains.

This is a Vue3 + TypeScript dApp designed for end users. It provides a simple interface to connect to the Tezos blockchain network, mint NFTs and explore the minted artworks associated with your FA2 smart contract (which must comply with the [OpenArtBlocks smart contract specifications](https://github.com/GenArtLabs/OpenArtBlocks-Smart-Contract-Tezos)).
